# Lyntai (灵台) — Active Task Backlog

> **This file holds OPEN tasks only** — the live backlog. Completed work is not left here: once a task is
> fully done (committed + verified), its entry is **moved to [`docs/task-archive.md`](docs/task-archive.md)**
> (the completed-task record) rather than checked off in place. See the lifecycle rule
> `.claude/rules/task-lifecycle.md`. `CHANGELOG.md` remains the release-facing log; the archive is the
> per-task record (why/how). The design contract is `docs/2026-07-17-lyntai-design.md`; the forward
> sequence is `docs/ROADMAP.md`.

**Goal:** a NuGet-packable, DI-first .NET 10 library — an LLM provider abstraction (routing + fallback
across CLI / HTTP / lambda-bridged providers), pluggable storage (SQLite / InMemory / Postgres), and the
LLM-ops layer (prompt registry, scoring, traces, memory). `AddLyntai(...)` and go.

## Active backlog

_**The archive is where closed work lives** — `docs/task-archive.md`, one Part per task, with why and how;
this file does not summarize it. `CHANGELOG.md` is the release-facing log, and everything before 3.0 is
history rather than context (`repo-mechanics.md`)._

**What is open is the TABLE at the head of this file, and it is GENERATED.** Every checkbox carries an
`<!-- item: state=… kind=… needs="…" -->` marker; `node devtools/dev.mjs check-backlog --write` rebuilds the
table from those markers and `verify` fails while the two disagree, so the roster and the items can no
longer drift apart. Edit the marker, never the table — the COUNT lives there and nowhere else, so this
sentence names no number — **nor a Part**, the same rot one step out: it named Part 102 as "most of what is
startable" until Part 103 opened bigger. **The accumulation that hid these is GATED, not watched for**:
`check-backlog` fails a `## Part` holding no open checkbox.

**Re-checking an `env` item asks whether the artifact is OBTAINABLE, not whether it is installed** —
`task-lifecycle.md` §A blocked item, which two re-checks here got wrong before a reader did.
**An `env` blocker also EXPIRES
SILENTLY** — Part 65 read "this machine holds exactly one chat model" for two weeks while three sat on
disk, every one already used by other measurements here. Nothing fails when an environment GROWS, so
nothing announces it; **re-check every `env` item before concluding there is no work.**
**A REFUTATION is the fifth route an item arrives by, and the most reliable**: disproving the obvious answer
names the next candidate, which is how Part 217 arrived narrowed to one signal of three. The others are a
ruling, a captured failure, and a design REVIEW — the only one schedulable on purpose, and the only one
that has twice filled a whole Part in one pass (Part 179, then Part 221) where every other route yields
ones and twos. `decision-only` was invented for GEN6 and earns its keep whenever a SWEEP declines to answer
a question rather than settle it by momentum — a rename nobody examined decides something invisibly. That
sentence is hand-written on purpose: the banner it replaces advertised finished work **four** times.

**Where things stand is NOT summarized here, deliberately.** `docs/memory-measurements.md` §5 is the measurement record,
`docs/task-archive.md` holds one Part per closed task, `docs/DECISIONS.md` holds what was decided and why,
and `docs/FIXES.md` holds per-incident fixes. A copy of any of those goes stale the moment the original is
amended, which is why this section stopped carrying one on 2026-09-10.

_**Why this section is short, and the discipline that keeps it short.** It reached 478 lines carrying ZERO
open checkboxes — five stacked `HANDOVER` blocks and a running tally of what had closed, for 17 open items
in a 1308-line file. `task-lifecycle.md` already forbade exactly that ("never let the backlog SUMMARIZE the
archive"), and the section had even documented deleting a 49-line tally for that reason on 2026-09-03 —
then regrew a 19-line one in its place. **A rule that keeps being violated is a missing gate**, so
`check-backlog` now bounds this section; see `dev.mjs`. The content was not lost: the handovers describe
Parts 143–176, which is where they live._

**BLOCKED IS PER ITEM, never per Part** — which is why the state lives on the checkbox rather than in a
roster of Parts. Part 33 was once marked blocked in full while two startable pieces sat inside it (they
closed as **D67** and **D68**). A blocked item names its blocker's KIND as well — `tree`/`env`/`decision`/
`data` — because each is refuted by looking somewhere different, and the rest of that discipline is
`task-lifecycle.md`'s. `watch` and `decision-only` exist because a checkbox can express neither, and both
were being counted as startable work.

## Part 33 — generation platform: remaining backends + composition

_Part 32 (MED1: the generation platform + the 2.0.1 package restructure) landed 2026-08-04 — see
`docs/task-archive.md` Part 32, `docs/DECISIONS.md` D24/D25, and the plans of record
`local/superpowers/plans/2026-08-04-generation-platform-plan.md` +
`local/superpowers/plans/2026-08-04-restructure-2.0.1-plan.md`. What remains are
that plan's Plans 3–7, each a separate pass because each needs its own measurement.
<br>**Nothing below EXECUTES from that plan any more, which is why it left `docs/` (D149).** Its Plan 6
still names a streaming interface **D127** deleted and its Plan 7 predates the 2026-08-30 3D survey and
GEN7a shipping, so the three item bodies below are the current framing and the plan is the record of how
the core was built._

_GEN3 (local `sd-cli`), GEN4 (durable renders + the fal.ai queue backend), GEN6's tool/MCP bridge half and
GEN5 (governance + telemetry parity) all landed 2026-08-04 — see `docs/task-archive.md` Part 33._

_**What remains unmeasured: fal's wire format, and it alone needs a vendor.** `sd-cli` left this list on
2026-09-19 (argv + clamp measured against a real engine, correcting the retired `img2img` mode value —
`docs/task-archive.md` Part 261), and ComfyUI followed the same day IN FULL: the HTTP surface over an image
graph (Part 262), then a video-producing workflow (Part 264) — which needed no video MODEL, because the
provider only ever reads the history document, and a core-node MP4 measures that document's video shape.
The fal-first naming that once hid ComfyUI inside this list is recorded in
`.claude/knowledge/pitfalls.md`._

- [ ] **GEN-VERIFY-FAL — one submit → poll → fetch against fal.ai with a real key**, checking the status <!-- item: state=blocked kind=env needs="a fal.ai account and key — nobody here has one, and no download substitutes for it" -->
  vocabulary, the result field names and what `cost` reports. Then delete that backend's "unverified" notes
  or fix the mapping.

  _**This is fal's OWN wire format and nothing else.** It is not the generation platform's verification
  story and must not be treated as one — the two sibling items above cover the other two backends without
  a vendor, and the video DELIVERY path is reachable through ComfyUI. Filed narrowly on purpose, because
  the old bundled item let "we are waiting on fal" stand in for "the platform is unverified"._

  _**This half IS blocked, and it is the rule's own example of one**: a vendor key or an account, which no
  download can supply. Split from the `sd-cli` half on 2026-09-16 because they were always independent —
  the old single item said so itself — and bundling them let the real blocker hide a startable one behind
  it for weeks._

  _**The BLOCKING half is gone (2026-08-16, `docs/DECISIONS.md` D69) — what is left is confirmation, not
  repair.** Every mapping that could be wrong is now a host option: fal's status vocabulary and cost fields,
  ComfyUI's four response field names, and `sd-cli`'s whole argv plus an `ExtraArgs` escape. So an adopting
  application that discovers the real wire format fixes it in `appsettings.json` and keeps going — it no
  longer waits on a Lyntai release, which is what made this item block anything. Reframed deliberately: the
  old wording made a third party's availability a precondition for this backlog being clean, and the library
  cannot promise to have called every vendor._

  _**What a real run is still for**, stated so this is not read as closed: a STRUCTURAL difference — a status
  that is not a string field at all, a history document shaped differently — is not fixable by a per-field
  option. The residual risk is a shape, not a spelling._

  _**The binary-directory working dir is CONFIRMED (2026-08-04)** and no longer part of this task — measured by
  a consuming app against a real downloaded release: the engine ships `ggml*.dll` beside the exe, so spawning
  from anywhere else fails at load time on a perfectly good install. Already implemented (the spawn's working
  directory in `LocalDiffusionProvider.GenerateAsync`) and pinned by a test._

  _**The max-dimension question is SETTLED (2026-08-16, `docs/DECISIONS.md` D68) and is no longer part of this
  task.** It asked whether `LocalDiffusionOptions` should carry a max-dimension, whether a CPU build should cap
  itself, or whether an unbounded size is the caller's problem. The answer: the ceiling is DERIVED from a
  declared `Accelerator` — `Cpu` (the default) derives the consumer's measured 768, `Gpu` derives none, and
  `MaxDimension` overrides either. A declaration, never a probe. What remains below is the ARGV, which still
  needs a real render._

  _Two more facts from that same measurement, **already true here** — recorded so they aren't re-investigated:
  the binary is `sd-cli.exe` (upstream renamed it from `sd.exe`), and the tree contains zero `sd.exe`
  references while `LocalDiffusionOptions.BinaryPath` has no default at all, so there is nothing to correct;
  and it is a plain CPU x64 build (no GPU, no CUDA), which is what makes it viable as a zero-setup backend.
  **The hazard to respect IF binary resolution is ever added:** the release zip contains `sd-cli.exe` AND
  `sd-server.exe`, so a loose `sd`-prefix match selects the SERVER — presenting as a HANG rather than an error,
  because the server starts and waits. Today `BinaryPath` is an explicit host-supplied path with no PATH probe
  and no prefix match, which is precisely why that hazard doesn't exist — don't introduce one._

  _Expect the argv + clamp half to close **from use, not from a harness here**: that consumer's live test stops
  at `--help` (a render needs a ~1.7 GB model download per run), but it is migrating its media stack onto
  `Lyntai.Generation`, and driving a real render with real weights for a real use case is what that migration
  does. Measuring where there is a real setup and a real use case is the owner's stated preference, and is why
  this never blocked a release — 3.0 ships the package under the full SemVer promise (**D70**)._

- [ ] **GEN7 — pipelines (3d → image → video)**: ordered stages feeding `artifact.ToInput(role)` forward, with <!-- item: state=startable -->
  per-stage candidates and per-stage failure semantics.
  <br>**RE-CHECKED 2026-09-23 (`docs/task-archive.md` Part 279's wide check), and the structural blocker is REFUTED: the
  rasterizer does not have to live in this library, because ComfyUI's CORE now carries one.** Read from the
  local ComfyUI 0.36.0 source, not a vendor page: `RenderMesh` (`comfy_extras/nodes_mesh_postprocess.py`)
  ray-casts a `MESH` to an `IMAGE` server-side, auto-framing a front view; `RotateMesh` gives the other views;
  `SaveGLB` writes one; `Get3DComponents` turns an uploaded GLB into a `MESH`; Hunyuan3D and TRELLIS2 generate
  one. So `image → mesh → rendered views → video` is a chain of ComfyUI graphs the existing HTTP adapter
  shape can drive, exactly as ComfyUI already hosts image and video.
  <br>**First step — no 3D MODEL needed, the trick Part 264's video used:** a headless graph
  `Load3D → Get3DComponents → SaveGLB` and one `… → RenderMesh → SaveImage` over an uploaded GLB, to measure
  what the history document says for a 3D output and whether a GLB uploads as an input. Then the ComfyUI
  provider declares `ProviderKinds.Model3d` and accepts a mesh input; a generating stage needs a
  Hunyuan3D/TRELLIS2 download, which is a step, not a blocker.
  **Blocker restated 2026-08-11 — the original "deferred until ≥2 real backends exist" now reads as SATISFIED
  and is the wrong test.** Counted by kind rather than by total: **image has 5** backends (`Automatic1111`,
  `ComfyUi`, `FalQueue`, `LocalDiffusion`, `OpenAiImage`), **video has 2** (`ComfyUi`, `FalQueue`) — and
  **3d has ZERO**. `ProviderKinds.Model3d` exists in the contract and no provider declares it. **The
  pipeline's FIRST STAGE has no backend at all**, which is a harder blocker than any count, and the one the
  original wording hid.
  Both video backends also still carry unverified-surface markers — precisely what GEN-VERIFY covers — so
  "real" in the measured sense is not yet true of the output stage either.
  **The survey RAN on 2026-08-30 (`docs/task-archive.md` Part 124) and its answer is that neither option was
  on the menu.** It asked mesh vs turntable stills; the dominant 3D family returns a **mesh and nothing
  renderable** (Hunyuan3D, Rodin), a minority adds a **single preview thumbnail** (Meshy) which is one fixed
  view rather than a turntable, and **turntable output belongs to a different model family altogether**
  (SV3D-class orbital synthesis), which is **image→views** and so does not occupy a 3D stage's place in the
  chain. **So `3d → image → video` corresponds to no buildable chain today, and the chain that IS buildable
  (`image → orbital views → video`) has no 3D stage in it.** The 3d→image edge is not a generation at all —
  it is a RASTERIZATION, which no vendor on this platform performs.
  <br>**What that unblocked was the runner at `image → video`, and it SHIPPED on 2026-08-30** as GEN7a
  (`docs/task-archive.md` Part 126): `router.RunPipelineAsync(stages)`, ordered stages chaining through
  `MediaArtifact.ToInput(role)`. A stage is a stage, so **adding a 3D stage later needs no change to the
  runner** — which is what made building it an unblocking rather than a narrowing. What is left of GEN7 is
  therefore the 3D STAGE alone. A rasterizer is the only thing that makes a
  mesh chain and it belongs to an application with a renderer, never inside a library whose core promise is a
  small dependency footprint (`dotnet-package-layout.md` §Package boundaries).
  <br>**Two defects on the OUTPUT stage were found while establishing that, and both are FIXED**
  (`docs/task-archive.md` Part 125) — `ComfyUiProvider` declaring `SupportsInputs = true` while never
  reading `request.Inputs`, and `ProviderKinds.Model3d`'s shipped XML doc claiming a chain that does not
  exist. So they no longer gate the runner below.
  <br>_Desk survey: read from published API pages, never called. That is the tier GEN-VERIFY exists to
  distrust, so the SHAPES transfer and no individual field name is confirmed — nothing in it licenses
  deleting an unverified marker._

## Part 75 — what the pre-3.0 review deferred, and why (2026-08-15)

_Opened by `docs/task-archive.md` **Part 74**. Each of these was found, verified and deliberately NOT fixed
in that pass — and every one was startable, which is why the banner stopped claiming otherwise while they
were open. All have now closed (archive Parts 76, 78–81 and 84) except the one below, whose blocker is not
a design question: it needs two or three real aggregators to measure against._

- [ ] **Decide what an aggregator's in-band `code` means.** `HttpBody.InBandError` deliberately reports <!-- item: state=blocked kind=env,data needs="two or three real aggregators to measure an in-band code against" -->
  only THAT an `error` member is present and what it says; it does not read a numeric `code` as an HTTP
  status, because that mapping is not measured across the gateways this provider serves. A 200 carrying
  `{"error":{"code":429}}` therefore classifies from the message text alone. Measuring two or three real
  aggregators would let the code lead, which is strictly better than text matching — but reading it
  unmeasured is the documented-not-measured trap GEN-VERIFY exists to correct.

## Part 99 — what the memory pass did NOT close (2026-08-26)

_Opened by `docs/task-archive.md` **Part 97**, which closed every other Phase-1 invariant of the memory
proposal. Named here rather than left implied, because a scorecard that reads as complete is how a gap stops
being looked for._

_It opened holding the two Phase-1 gaps. One of those (cross-tenant isolation) closed the same day as
**Part 100** and left a DECISION behind it; the flake below arrived from watching `verify` rather than from
the proposal. **One item is left open here** — the rest closed into the archive, and this line said "all
three are startable" until 2026-08-28, after two of them had gone._

_**It is a WATCH item, not startable work, and the banner counted it as startable until 2026-08-28.** The
suspected cause is fixed AND pinned — `ProcessRunnerTests.A_FAILED_path_lookup_is_not_cached_so_one_transient_locator_failure_is_not_permanent`,
which carries a positive control so it cannot pass on an implementation that simply caches nothing. So
there is nothing here to code: what remains is evidence only recurrence can supply._

- [ ] **`verify`'s test step intermittently fails EXACTLY 9 tests, and once aborted mid-run.** Observed <!-- item: state=watch kind=data needs="the same nine tests to recur — the fix is unconfirmed as the cure, and a green run is not evidence" -->
  twice in roughly ten `verify` runs on 2026-08-26, and **not once in any standalone `node devtools/dev.mjs
  test`**, which passed every time including immediately before and after a failing `verify`. A third run
  ABORTED at 2088/2108 — a crash rather than a failure — and took 6m20s against the usual ~3m.
  <br>**CAPTURED on the third occurrence, and the names refute the obvious hypothesis.** The guess was
  Postgres — 9 is a plausible size for one Testcontainers fixture class, and it is the only part of the
  suite with an external dependency. **Not one of the nine is a Postgres test:**

  ```
  CortexIntegrationTests.Evaluate_persists_results_to_the_score_store
  CortexIntegrationTests.Llm_judge_scorer_returns_the_stub_verdict
  RouterEndToEndTests.Healthy_primary_cli_serves_and_http_is_never_called
  RouterEndToEndTests.Streaming_never_falls_back_after_the_first_token
  RouterEndToEndTests.Dead_host_cooldown_skips_then_retries_after_expiry
  AddClaudeCliTests.Registered_provider_serves_through_the_router_by_id
  ClaudeCliProviderTests.Explicit_command_makes_the_provider_available
  CodexCliProviderTests.A_portable_install_is_wired_without_touching_the_process_environment
  ProcessRunnerTests.Resolve_command_path_finds_node_and_caches
  ```

  **Every one of them spawns a process or resolves a command on PATH**, and the whole set is explained by
  the last one failing: the CLI-provider and router-e2e tests all reach the deterministic provider-stub
  through `LYNTAI_PROVIDER_CMD`, which is `node`. If `ProcessRunner` cannot resolve `node`, all nine fall
  together — one cause, nine symptoms, and a constant count is exactly what that predicts.
  <br>**Why only under `verify`** is then the question worth asking, and the shape of an answer is already
  <br>**RECURRED 2026-09-15, and ALONE — which narrows the hypothesis rather than confirming it.** One of
  the nine failed by itself under `verify`
  (`CodexCliProviderTests.A_portable_install_is_wired_without_touching_the_process_environment`,
  `Assert.True` on `IsAvailable`), passed 3/3 standalone immediately after, and the very next `verify` was
  green with the same tree. So the "one cause, nine symptoms, constant count" reading is too strong: a
  resolution can fail for ONE caller without taking the other eight, which an all-or-nothing PATH outage
  would not do. A per-entry cache race fits; a global `node`-not-on-PATH window does not.
  <br>**The count is therefore NOT the signature** — nine was one observation of it, not its shape, and a
  future single-test failure in this list is the same bug rather than a new one.
  in `.claude/rules/windows-machine.md`: `verify` runs `test-devtools`, `build` and nine gates before the
  test step, `check-samples` spawning Roslyn over ~78 samples, so the test step starts after heavy process
  churn. Look at `ProcessRunner.ResolveLauncher`'s CACHE first — the failing test is named
  `..._finds_node_and_caches`, and a cache that can memoize a transient failure would produce precisely
  this: intermittent, all-or-nothing, and invisible to a standalone run that starts clean.
  <br>**Do not close this by observing a green run.** It was green 11 times out of 14, including twice
  consecutively while trying to reproduce it on purpose.
  <br>**A REAL BUG matching every symptom was found and fixed the same day** (`docs/FIXES.md`,
  `pitfalls.md`): `ProcessRunner.ResolveCommandPath` cached FAILED lookups into a process-wide static, so
  one transient `where.exe` failure made `node` unresolvable for the rest of the run — which fails exactly
  these nine at once and explains the constant count, the all-or-nothing shape, and why a standalone run
  that starts clean never saw it.
  <br>**This item stays OPEN, on purpose.** The mechanism fits every observation and the flake was never
  reproduced on demand, so the fix is unconfirmed as the CURE. **If the nine recur, this was not it** — and
  that is the only evidence that can close this. Watch for it; do not close it by observing green runs,
  which is what the line above already says and is now doubly true.

  <br>**A ONE-test flake was seen 2026-09-09** under `verify`, green on the standalone run immediately after
  and green on the next `verify`. It is recorded here rather than as a new item because it is the same
  SHAPE — intermittent, only under `verify`, unreproducible on demand — but it is NOT the nine, so it does
  not confirm or refute the `ProcessRunner` fix this item watches. The name was not captured; capture it if
  it recurs, which is the only thing that would make it actionable.

- [ ] **`SqliteCuratedMemoryStoreTests.Dedup_race` disposes a connection another caller is still using.** <!-- item: state=watch kind=data needs="a recurrence with a full stack — the three hypotheses a reading can reach are refuted, so the next move needs the frame that raised it" -->
  **Captured 2026-09-14 — a name, an exception, and a reproduction, which is what the note above asked for
  and did not get.** `System.ObjectDisposedException: Cannot access a disposed object. Object name:
  'SQLitePCL.sqlite3'`, thrown inside `SqliteConnectionFactory.OpenAsync`
  (`src/Lyntai.Storage.Sqlite/SqliteConnectionFactory.cs`) while the test exercises concurrent dedup.
  <br>**It is NOT the flake above, and the difference is the whole point:** that one is *only* under
  `verify` and has never reproduced standalone. This one failed **1 of 3 standalone runs** of its own
  class — so it is not `verify`-specific, not process-churn, and not the nine. Nothing here touches
  `ProcessRunner`.
  <br>**Startable, and the reproduction is the cheap part** — loop the single class until it fails. What
  makes it worth doing rather than muting: the exception says a connection was DISPOSED while in use, and
  the same factory serves every SQLite domain. A test that fails a third of the time is also a gate that
  passes two thirds of the time for the wrong reason.
  <br>**2026-09-15: did not reproduce in 8 consecutive runs, and the "shipped storage code" reading is
  REFUTED — three hypotheses, each checked by reading rather than by re-running.** (1) A double dispose in
  `SqliteCuratedMemoryStore.AddAsync`: no — connection and transaction are both `await using`, disposed in
  the right order, and the factory builds a fresh `SqliteConnection` per call and disposes it on failure.
  (2) `SqliteConnection.ClearAllPools()` evicting a concurrent test's handle: already fixed —
  `TempDbPath.Dispose` clears only its OWN db's pool and `TempDb` delegates to it. The trap is now in
  `pitfalls.md`, where it was not. (3) Work outliving the test method: no — every task in
  `Dedup_add_race_settles_to_a_stable_id` is awaited through `Task.WhenAll`.
  <br>**So it is `watch · data` rather than startable**: what it needs is a recurrence carrying the frame
  BELOW `OpenAsync`, because the three causes a reading can reach are gone and the remaining ones are all
  in the runner's resource behaviour — the same shape as Part 99 above, by a different mechanism.

## Part 286 — what the live-route review found outside its scope (2026-09-24)

_Opened by the final review of `docs/task-archive.md` **Part 284**. Both were verified against the tree and
ruled out of that Part's scope rather than left implied; both are startable._

- [ ] **A configured text candidate naming a NON-text backend is still called.** `TextRouter.SelectLive` <!-- item: state=startable -->
  (`src/Lyntai.Core/Inference/TextRouter.cs`) never reads `ProviderCapabilities.Produces`, so a given
  candidate naming a registered embedder, reranker or media backend is called on the text path and returns
  `Unsupported` — which memory's fail-open seams swallow. Live-route entries are filtered by kind now
  (`ServesText`, **D176**); given candidates never were. Decide where the check belongs — at composition, as
  **D119** and `ClientCandidates.OutsideThePool` fail a provably dead configuration, or per call as the route
  does — and apply one rule to both.
- [ ] **Gate "no default body on a member of an interface the library decorates".** **D67** states the rule <!-- item: state=startable -->
  and `.claude/knowledge/pitfalls.md` records it broken a FOURTH time — the async capability probe, caught by
  review, now pinned for its two members alone by `TextClientTests.The_capability_probe_has_no_default_body`.
  A rule written down and still violated is a missing gate (CLAUDE.md §Dev loop). First step: define
  "decorated" mechanically — a Core interface with a `Delegating*` base or a Core decorator implementing it
  — and measure the tree against that definition before choosing the gate's shape.

## Part 287 — what an adopting application's reranker screen found (2026-09-24)

_An adopting application screened four sub-500 MB rerankers on llama.cpp b10549 against this repository's
reference pair and its own harder pair, then benched the survivors on its own zh/en fixture. Its results
answer two open questions in `docs/model-tasks.md` §3.2 and expose one library defect in three parts and two
instrument gaps. The owner ruled: record the measurements, fix everything, one item at a time. The
measurements are recorded (`docs/memory-measurements.md` §5, `rerank-screen-adopter-b10549` and
`rerank-bench-adopter-zh-en-240`; `docs/model-tasks.md` §3 / §3.2), and llama.cpp's over-context rejection
now classifies as the input's fault with a repeating verification failure at Warning (`docs/FIXES.md`
2026-09-24), and an over-long input to an HTTP reranker or embedder is segmented rather than sent whole
(`HttpModelOptions.MaxInputChars`, **D177**). `rerank-screen` now asserts an English and a Chinese overlap
trap and reads a decisive [0, 1] pair as probabilities (`.claude/knowledge/pitfalls.md`, the reranker
smoke-test entries); what remains is below._

- [ ] **The ONNX provider CUTS an over-long input silently.** `OnnxCrossEncoderHead` and <!-- item: state=startable -->
  `OnnxPoolingHead` (`src/Lyntai.Providers.Onnx/`) encode at `OnnxProviderOptions.MaxTokens` and drop the
  rest. Owner ruling 2026-09-24: follow the rule **D177** applied to the HTTP provider, segmenting by TOKENS
  (exact here, where the HTTP side can only count characters) and combining the pieces the same way.

## Retired — five Parts that outlived their open work (2026-09-16)

_Parts 109, 116, 128 and 178 held **295 lines and zero open checkboxes** between them: every line was a
"CLOSED as archive Part N" note, which is what `.claude/rules/task-lifecycle.md` forbids in as many words.
They are `docs/task-archive.md` **Parts 233–236** respectively, one per thread, each naming where its
halves landed and what it leaves standing. **Part 233, which filed the retirement, went with them** —
`docs/task-archive.md` **Part 238**, both items._

_**The rule is now a gate**: `check-backlog` fails a `## Part` heading holding no open checkbox, so this
cannot regrow unnoticed a third time. A heading that is not `## Part <n>` — this one — is invisible to it,
which is what lets a retirement leave a pointer behind without tripping the rule it just satisfied._

_**They are numbered 233–236 in the ARCHIVE and were 109/116/128/178 HERE** — the two files number
independently, so a Part keeps its backlog number until it closes and the archive allocates in LANDING
order. Name the file in every citation._

_**BL1 was filed saying all four numbers COLLIDE, and only one does.** `docs/task-archive.md` Part 178 is
an unrelated task (the cold-start measurement); 109, 116 and 128 are simply gaps there. The item's
conclusion survives its wrong premise — they could not keep their numbers anyway, because the archive
allocates in landing order rather than reserving a backlog number — but the reason is the ORDER, not a
clash. Recorded because the wrong version was repeated from the item into this note before anyone checked
it, which is the whole failure mode `check-links` cannot see: a `Part N` claim about a Part that does not
exist reads exactly like one about a Part that does._

## How to work a task (evergreen)

- **TDD, every task:** failing test → run it fail → minimal impl → run it pass → commit. Read
  `.claude/rules/dotnet-package-layout.md` (package layout) + `.claude/rules/repo-mechanics.md` (this
  repo's bindings — package names, naming invariant, dev loop, test conventions), then the relevant
  `.claude/knowledge/*` (migrations → `storage.md` / `sql-storage.md`; spawn hygiene →
  `llm-and-router.md`) + `.claude/skills/*` before extending.
- **Commit per task.** **Never commit without the user's approval.** Describe changes structurally in the
  message (no dev-machine paths / private tokens — the pre-commit guard enforces this).
- **This is a generic library** — every task must be a reusable, app-agnostic improvement behind the
  `ITextClient` front door / a BYO seam, never app-specific code. Update the `ApiSurface` baselines
  deliberately on any public-surface change.
- **Deviate from a task's suggested steps when the code disagrees** — the spec's *contract* (interfaces,
  semantics) is authoritative; a task's step list is a suggestion. Record real deviations in the commit
  message.
- **When a task completes, archive it** (`.claude/rules/task-lifecycle.md`): move its entry (with the
  completion date + a one-line **Outcome**) into `docs/task-archive.md`, and delete it from here.
