# Lyntai (灵台) — Active Task Backlog

> **This file holds OPEN tasks only** — the live backlog. Completed work is not left here: once a task is
> fully done (committed + verified), its entry is **moved to [`docs/task-archive.md`](docs/task-archive.md)**
> (the completed-task record) rather than checked off in place. See the lifecycle rule
> `.claude/rules/task-lifecycle.md`. `CHANGELOG.md` remains the release-facing log; the archive is the
> per-task record (why/how). The design contract is `docs/2026-07-17-lyntai-design.md`; the forward
> sequence is `docs/ROADMAP.md`.

**Goal:** a NuGet-packable, DI-first .NET 10 library — an LLM provider abstraction (routing + fallback
across CLI / API / MEAI-bridged providers), pluggable storage (SQLite / InMemory / Postgres), and the
LLM-ops layer (prompt registry, scoring, traces, memory). `AddLyntai(...)` and go.

## Active backlog

_**v2.0.1 is released (2026-08-04).** Everything up to and including the generation platform, the package
restructure and the 2.0.1 release hardening has shipped and is archived — see `docs/task-archive.md` Parts 29–35
and `docs/DECISIONS.md` D25–D34. What remains open is below: the generation follow-ups in Part 33 (all needing a
real service or a vendor pick), the two consumer-ergonomics findings in Part 34, the post-1.0 additive backlog in
Part 25, and one conditional item:_

- [ ] **JSON source-gen envelopes (optional; see `docs/DECISIONS.md` D17)** — typed
  `JsonSerializerContext` envelope types for the STABLE response envelopes only, **if envelope-parsing bugs ever
  materialize** (none have). Not a license to reintroduce reflection serialization.

## Part 33 — generation platform: remaining backends + composition

_Part 32 (MED1: the generation platform + the 2.0.1 package restructure) landed 2026-08-04 — see
`docs/task-archive.md` Part 32, `docs/DECISIONS.md` D30/D31, and the plans of record
`docs/2026-08-04-generation-platform-plan.md` + `docs/2026-08-04-restructure-2.0.1-plan.md`. What remains are
that plan's Plans 3–7, each a separate pass because each needs its own measurement._

_GEN3 (local `sd-cli`), GEN4 (durable renders + the fal.ai queue backend), GEN6's tool/MCP bridge half and
GEN5 (governance + telemetry parity) all landed 2026-08-04 — see `docs/task-archive.md` Part 33. GEN3/GEN4 carry
an **unmeasured-surface** caveat to close the first time they run for real: the `sd-cli` argv/size clamping is
ported-not-measured, and fal's wire format is documented-not-measured. (`sd-cli`'s binary-directory working dir
was the third such surface — a consuming app measured it 2026-08-04 and it is now confirmed.)_

- [ ] **GEN-VERIFY — confirm the remaining unmeasured surfaces against reality.** For `sd-cli`: run one render
  and check the argv and the multiple-of-64 clamp. For fal: one submit → poll → fetch with a real key, checking
  the status vocabulary, the result field names and what `cost` reports. Then delete the remaining "unverified"
  notes from the XML docs — or fix the mappings and keep them.

  _**The binary-directory working dir is CONFIRMED (2026-08-04)** and no longer part of this task — measured by
  a consuming app against a real downloaded release: the engine ships `ggml*.dll` beside the exe, so spawning
  from anywhere else fails at load time on a perfectly good install. Already implemented
  (`src/Lyntai.Generation/LocalDiffusionProvider.cs:139`) and pinned by a test._

  _Two more facts from that same measurement, **already true here** — recorded so they aren't re-investigated:
  the binary is `sd-cli.exe` (upstream renamed it from `sd.exe`), and the tree contains zero `sd.exe`
  references while `LocalDiffusionOptions.BinaryPath` has no default at all, so there is nothing to correct;
  and it is a plain CPU x64 build (no GPU, no CUDA), which is what makes it viable as a zero-setup backend.
  **The hazard to respect IF binary resolution is ever added:** the release zip contains `sd-cli.exe` AND
  `sd-server.exe`, so a loose `sd`-prefix match selects the SERVER — presenting as a HANG rather than an error,
  because the server starts and waits. Today `BinaryPath` is an explicit host-supplied path with no PATH probe
  and no prefix match, which is precisely why that hazard doesn't exist — don't introduce one._

  _Expect the argv + clamp half to close **from use, not from a harness here**: that consumer's live test stops
  at `--help` (a render needs a ~1.7 GB model download per run), but it is migrating its media stack onto
  `Lyntai.Generation`, and driving a real render with real weights for a real use case is what that migration
  does. Measuring where there is a real setup and a real use case is the owner's stated preference, and is why
  the experimental marker needn't block anything._

- [ ] **GEN6 — streaming audio (TTS).** A streaming TTS backend to exercise `IGenerationStreamProvider` end to
  end — nothing implements that seam yet, so it is the one contract in the platform no real backend has
  exercised. **TTS before music** (owner). Needs a vendor pick and a MEASURED wire format (the GEN-VERIFY
  lesson), so it waits on a key rather than shipping another documented-not-measured surface.
- [ ] **GEN7 — pipelines (3d → image → video)**: ordered stages feeding `artifact.ToInput(role)` forward, with
  per-stage candidates and per-stage failure semantics. Deferred until ≥2 real backends exist so the runner
  isn't designed on guesses. Needs a 3D-backend survey first (mesh vs turntable stills — only the latter chains
  into today's video backends).

> Add new tasks here as checklist items with an `id` and a short `file:line` where known. Group related
> tasks under a `## Part N — <theme>` heading. Move an item to the archive when it lands — don't leave a
> `[x]` here.

## Part 34 — findings from the pre-2.0.1 consumer smoke (2026-08-04)

_Restoring the packed bundle into a fresh app and compiling against the 2.0.1 surface (rather than project
references) proved the install story works, and exposed two asymmetries between the domains. Neither blocks the
release; both are additive._

- [ ] **generation backend wiring helpers** — now the obvious first addition to the new `Lyntai.Generation`
  package, which ships five backends and no `Add*` methods. The LLM side has `AddOllamaProvider()` /
  `AddOpenAiProvider()` / `AddAzureOpenAiProvider()`, while every generation backend must be hand-constructed
  WITH its `Func<HttpClient>`:
  `.AddGenerationProvider(_ => new OpenAiImageProvider(options, () => new HttpClient()))`. Add the matching
  `AddOpenAiImageProvider()` / `AddAutomatic1111Provider()` / `AddComfyUiProvider()` / `AddFalProvider()` shims
  (BYO `HttpClient` staying optional, per v0.7). Same class of gap as the semantic-memory wiring helper below.
- [ ] **LLM-side parity for the no-credentials verdict** — `GenerationVerdictClassifier.FromHttpFailure(status,
  body, hasCredentials)` now reports a 401 with NO key supplied as `NotConfigured` rather than `AuthFailed`, so
  routing skips an unconfigured backend blamelessly instead of benching it. `OpenAiCompatibleProvider` /
  `HttpEmbedder` have the same shape and still report `AuthFailed`. Deliberately NOT changed here: that is
  released behaviour, and a verdict change belongs in its own considered commit, not a pre-release sweep.

## Part 25 — post-1.0 backlog (deferred at the 1.0 API-review triage, 2026-07-28)

_Additive / non-breaking items surfaced by the 1.0 adversarial API review + consumer-usage review (the
working record was `devtools/_review/*`; rejects + rationale are in `docs/DECISIONS.md` D21). None block
1.0 — each is safe to add in a post-1.0 minor._

- [ ] **async migration entry points** — `MigrateUpAsync(…, CancellationToken)` twins alongside the sync
  `MigrationRunnerService.MigrateUp` (SQLite + Postgres), for apps owning their schema under
  `SchemaMigration.None`.
- [ ] **semantic-memory wiring helper** — a DI seam / `Use*` helper so an app enabling semantic recall
  doesn't hand-construct `SqliteCuratedMemoryStore` / `SqliteVectorStore` / `MigratingConnectionFactory` /
  `HttpEmbedder` (a consumer does this today). Those concrete types STAY public for 1.0.
- [ ] **`AddMcpTools` convenience overload** — `params ITool[]` and/or document the
  `await McpToolset.FromClientAsync` → `AddMcpTools` two-step as the intended shape.
- [ ] **verdict helpers** — `reply.IsOk()` / `reply.IsRateLimited()` extension(s) to cut the 3-branch
  `LlmVerdict` pattern at call sites.
- [ ] **curated-memory ergonomics** — a `Source`/metadata convenience accessor (apps unpack
  `metadata["source"]` by hand after CMEM6); reconsider the delete+re-add for immutable `kind`/`task`/`scope`.
- [ ] **agent-event contract** — `ClaudeToolCalls.FilePathOf` should also read `notebook_path`/`path`;
  consider a discoverable event-shape contract instead of anonymous objects apps reflect over.
- [ ] **member/type XML docs** — `ExtensionsAiProvider` public ctor, `LyntaiChatClientExtensions` type
  summary, `ClaudeCliProvider` interface members, `AddMcpTools` intended-shape doc.
- [ ] **`OpenAiCompatibleOptions.ContextSize` legibility** — Ollama-only option with a generic name; a
  rename (e.g. `OllamaContextSize`) is BREAKING, so it's a major-bump-or-never item — accepted as-is for
  1.0, revisit only if it causes real confusion.

## How to work a task (evergreen)

- **TDD, every task:** failing test → run it fail → minimal impl → run it pass → commit. Read
  `.claude/rules/dev-conventions.md` (package layout, migrations, spawn hygiene) and the relevant
  `.claude/knowledge/*` + `.claude/skills/*` before extending.
- **Commit per task.** **Never commit without the user's approval.** Describe changes structurally in the
  message (no dev-machine paths / private tokens — the pre-commit guard enforces this).
- **This is a generic library** — every task must be a reusable, app-agnostic improvement behind the
  `ILlmClient` front door / a BYO seam, never app-specific code. Update the `ApiSurface` baselines
  deliberately on any public-surface change.
- **Deviate from a task's suggested steps when the code disagrees** — the spec's *contract* (interfaces,
  semantics) is authoritative; a task's step list is a suggestion. Record real deviations in the commit
  message.
- **When a task completes, archive it** (`.claude/rules/task-lifecycle.md`): move its entry (with the
  completion date + a one-line **Outcome**) into `docs/task-archive.md`, and delete it from here.
